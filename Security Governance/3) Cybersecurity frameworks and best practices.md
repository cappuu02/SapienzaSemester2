# Framework and NIST CSF

```ad-abstract
title: Cybersecurity Framework
 A structured set of guidelines, best practices, and standards for managing cybersecurity risks

```

```ad-info
title: A bit of History
In USA in 2014, President Obama defines the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. (CEA) It updated the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to include identifying and developing cybersecurity risk frameworks for voluntary use by critical infrastructure owners and operators

Through CEA, NIST must identify “a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach, including information security measures and controls that may be voluntarily adopted by owners and operators of critical infrastructure to help them identify, assess, and manage cyber risks”.

> CEA formalizes NIST’s previous work1 and provided guidance for future Framework  evolution.

```

 **Purpose**: Provides a roadmap to assess, improve, and communicate security posture.
 **Key Traits**:
- Standardized approach
- Risk-based and adaptable
- Continuous improvement

## NIST CSF
The framework focuses on using business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities and considering cybersecurity risks as part of the organization’s risk management processes. Consist of three parts:
- Core
- Implementation Tiers
- Profiles

## Applicability of NIST CSF
NIST CSF was developed to improve cybersecurity risk management in critical infrastructures, but it can be used by organizations in any sector or community. It provides a common organizing structure assembling standards, guidelines, and practices that are working effectively today. It is applicable to organizations relying on technology, whether their cybersecurity focus is primarily on
- information technology (IT),
- industrial control systems (ICS)
- cyber-physical systems (CPS)
- connected devices more generally, including the Internet of Things (IoT)

## NIST CSF Features
NIST CSF is technology neutral, It remains effective and supports technical innovation.
It references a variety of existing standards, guidelines, and practices that evolve with technology.
It provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to:
1. Describe their current cybersecurity posture;
2. Describe their target state for cybersecurity;
3. Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process;
4. Assess progress toward the target state;
5. Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk.

>NIST CSF supports cyber security assessment, planning and monitoring activities

## Risk Management and CSF
 ==RECALL==: Risk management is the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risk.

 To manage risk, organizations should understand the likelihood that an event will occur and the potential resulting impacts.

 With this information, organizations can determine the acceptable level of risk for achieving their organizational objectives and can express this as their risk tolerance.

## NIST CSF Core
 It provides a set of activities to achieve specific cybersecurity outcomes, and references examples of guidance to achieve those outcomes. The Core is not a checklist of actions to perform.

 It presents key cybersecurity outcomes identified by stakeholders as helpful in managing cybersecurity risk.  The Core comprises four elements:
1. Functions
2. Categories
3. Subcategories
4. Informative References

![[ISG 22.png|500]]

### NIST CSF Core Functions
 Functions organize basic cybersecurity activities at their highest level.
 ![[ISG23.png|500]]

### NIST CSF Core - Other Elements
Categories are the subdivisions of a Function into groups of cybersecurity outcomes closely tied to programmatic needs and particular activities.

```ad-example

Examples of Categories include “Asset Management,” “Identity Management and Access Control,” and “Detection Processes.”
```

 Subcategories further divide a Category into specific outcomes of technical and/or management activities. They provide a set of results that, while not exhaustive, help support achievement of the outcomes in each Category.

```ad-example

Examples of Subcategories include “External information systems are catalogued,” “Data-at-rest is protected,” and “Notifications from detection systems are investigated.”
```

Informative References are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices common among critical infrastructure sectors that illustrate a method to achieve the outcomes associated with each Subcategory.

![[ISG28.png]]

```

## Framework Implementation Tiers
 The Framework Implementation Tiers (“Tiers”) provide context on **how an organization views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk**. 
 Ranging from Partial (Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4), Tiers describe an increasing degree of rigor and sophistication in cybersecurity risk management practices.

>While organizations identified as Tier 1 (Partial) are encouraged to consider moving toward Tier 2 or greater, Tiers do not represent maturity levels.

Tiers are meant to support organizational decision making about how to manage cybersecurity risk, as well as which dimensions of the organization are higher priority and could receive additional resources.

Progression to higher Tiers is encouraged when a cost-benefit analysis indicates a feasible and cost-effective reduction of cybersecurity risk.

![[ISG31.png]]

## Framework Profile
The Framework Profile (“Profile”) is the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.

They can be used to describe the current state or the desired target state of specific cybersecurity activities.
- The Current Profile indicates the cybersecurity outcomes that are currently being achieved.
- The Target Profile indicates the outcomes needed to achieve the desired cybersecurity risk management goals.
- Support gap analysis

> This Framework does not prescribe Profile templates, allowing for flexibility in implementation

## How to use the framework
1. Basic Review of Cybersecurity Practices
2. Establishing or Improving a Cybersecurity Program
3. Communicating Cybersecurity Requirements with Stakeholders
4. Buying Decisions
5. Identifying Opportunities for New or Revised Informative References
6. Methodology to Protect Privacy and Civil Liberties
7. Self-Assessing Cybersecurity Risk with the Framework

# National Cybersecurity Framework
A primary objective of the modern cybersecurity framework is to elevate the awareness of cyber risk to the highest levels of business leadership. This issue is no longer solely a matter for technical staff but requires integration into the core of organizational governance. Consequently, organizations must systematically include cyber risk within their overall risk management processes, treating it as a fundamental component of economic risk.

This strategic shift must be considered within the specific context of the Italian economic landscape. A defining characteristic of this landscape is that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are responsible for 69% of the national GDP. In contrast, there are very few large national enterprises, which constitute approximately only 0.1% of the business population. This structure necessitates a tailored approach to national cybersecurity policy and implementation.

## Initial Objectives
Create something which is recognized at international level
Improve information sharing capacity
Increase the duty of care at the national level

Do not reinvent the wheel
- It makes no sense to create a new framework from scratch\
- Use a recognized framework as a starting point:
- NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity

```ad-abstract
title: Definition
The National Framework is not a standard and is not certifiable! It is a tool for self-assessment. Allows organizations to assess their current cybersecurity posture («current profile») and define the desired one («target profile»). Support in the gap analysis and the definition of a roadmap to close the gap between the current and the target profile

```

## From NIST CS Framework to Italian National Framework
 The National Framework can be «customized» so as to adapt it to a specific context (e.g. sectors, public administrations, organizations). The Framework can be adapted to a specific scenario through a Contextualization:
- Selection of Subcategories
- Definition of the Priority Level for each selected Subcategory
- Definition of the Maturity Levels and…

Given a Contextualization, it is possible to define:
- The Current Profile $\to$ The “as is” state
- A Target Profile $\to$ The “to be” state

![[ISG34.png|500]]

 A contextualization can be defined for
- A single organization
- An entire economic/productive sector 
- Groups of organizations based on scale (e.g. SME, Large Enterprises)
- Organizations belonging to regulated sectors (e.g. PAs, banks, …)
- Critical Infrastructures

![[ISG35.png|500]]
## Framework 2.0
Integration in the core of the new subcategories of the NIST CSF version 1.1

![[ISG36.png|500]]
![[ISG37.png|500]]

## Framework for CS & DP
![[ISG38.png|500]]

## Mapping Data Protection - Framework
There are $4$ possible cases:
1. Perfect placement
	- On 1 single subcategory
	- On more than one subcategory
2. Partial placement
	- On 1 single subcategory
	- On more than one subcategory
3. Not possible placement
	- Needs for a new subcategory
4. Not needed placement

## FISMA Ecosystem
USA President signs the E-government Act where in Title III “Federal Information System Management Act” requires that:

```ad-cite

each federal agency develops, documents and implements an agency-wide program to provide information security to all information and information systems that support assets and agency processes, including those provided or managed by other agencies, contractors or third parties
```

## Introduction to FISMA

Enacted in 2002, amended in 2014
Mandates security controls for federal information systems

>Objective: Protect data, ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability

![[ISG40.png|400]]

## Importance of FISMA Compliance
Why FISMA matters:
- federal requirement for agencies and contractors
- reduces risk of data breaches and cyber threats

Consequences of non-compliance:
- legal penalties
- reputational damage
- operational disruptions

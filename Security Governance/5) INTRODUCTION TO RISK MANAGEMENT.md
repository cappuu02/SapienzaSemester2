# Introduction

```ad-abstract
title: What is Risk?
Informally a risk is the potential that something goes wrong and thereby causes harm or loss.

```

A risk is the likelihood of an incident and its consequence for an asset.
- A **_likehood_** is the chance of something to occur.
- An **_incident_** is an event that harms or reduces the value of an asset.
- An **__asset__** is anything of value to a party.
- A **_party_** is an organization, company, person, group, or other body on whose behalf a risk assessment is conducted.
- A consequences is the impact of an incident on an asset in terms of harm or reduced asset value.

# Standard for Risk Management: ISO 31000
ISO 31000 provides guidelines on managing risk faced by organizations and can be customized to any organization and its context. It provides a common approach to managing any type of risk and is not industry or sector specific. It can be used throughout the life of the organization and can be applied to any activity, including decision-making at all levels. ISO 31000 cannot be used for certification purposes, but does provide guidance for internal or external audit programmes.

Organizations using it can compare their risk management practices with an internationally recognised benchmark, providing sound principles for effective management and corporate governance

## Principles
![[ISG51.png]]

## Framework
==Purpose==: assist the organization in integrating risk management into significant activities and functions.
==Effectiveness==: depends on the framework integration into the governance of the organization, including decision-making.

## Process
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
Suggests how to structure processes involved in the risk management activities 

```

![[ISG53.png]]

# Risk Management General Process
It is composed by $3$ main sub-processes:
![[ISG54.png]]

# Communication and Consulation
==Establish a Consultative Team==:
- This process may concern any part or activity of the overall risk management process. 
- Efficient and adequate communication and consultation support awareness 
- it is useful to establish a consultative team (or a single responsible in small companies) with defined responsibilities for the communication and consultation. 
- Consultative team typically includes internal stakeholders (e.g., decision makers, risk managers, employees with insight into the organization, board members, customers). 
- Roles and responsibilities of the team members must be clearly defined and specified.

==Define a Plan for Communication and Consultation==
- The consultative team (or those responsible for the communication and consultation) should be involved in defining the plan and procedures 
- organizations should establish procedures for how to support any of the processes of the overall risk management. This includes, for example, ensuring that 
	- different areas of expertise are brought together during risk assessments,
	- interests of all relevant stakeholders are considered, 
	- risk evaluation criteria are appropriate, and 
	- decision making is informed
- good procedures for communication and consultation help to ensure endorsement of and support for the risk management process 
- it is important to achieve a common agreement on and mutual understanding of how risk should be managed

Ensure Endorsement of the Risk Management Process
Communicate Risk Assessment Results

- The risk assessment results may be important for 
	- demonstrating policy adherence or compliance with directives and regulations. 
	- justifying treatment plans, including the required resources for risk mitigation. 
- Communicating the results helps those with a vested interest to understand the basis on which decisions are made and why particular actions are required. 
- This, in turn, helps to ensure endorsement of risk treatment plans from key stakeholders

# Risk Assessment Process
The risk assessment process is divided in 5 steps:
1. Step: Context Establishment
2. Step: Risk Identification
3. Step: Risk Analysis
4. Step: Risk Evaluation
5. Step: Risk Treatment

## Context Establishment
```ad-success
title: Goal
Identify and Describe the Context of the Risk Assessment process.

```

The first task to perform is the identification (and documentation) of the context relevant for the assessment:
- ==External Context==: description of societal, legal, regulatory, and financial environment and of the relationships with external stakeholders 
- ==Internal Context==: description of relevant goals, objectives, policies, and capabilities that may determine how risk should be assessed

Then, goals and objectives of the risk assessment must be defined 
- participation of decision makers is needed 

![[ISG48.png]]

### Context Description
The context description is the input for the risk assessment process and must contain:
1. Identification of the party involved in the Assessment 
2. Assumption declaration 
3. Relevant Assets identification for the Risk Assessment (focus of the assessment) 
4. Risk scales Definition 
	1. for consequences and likelihoods 
	2. they can be quantitative or qualitative, continuous, discrete, or given as intervals. 
5. risk evaluation criteria (terms of reference by which the significance of risk is assessed)

## Risk Identification
```ad-summary
title: Definition
The risk identification is the set of activities aiming to identify, describe, and document risks and possible causes of risk

```

>**_Observation 1_**: a risk is always associated with an incident

>**Observation 2**: there are three elements without which there can be no risk

![[ISG55.png]]

```ad-tip
title: Our Scope
Conduct the risk identification with respect to the identified assets by 
1. identifying threats and 
2. understanding how the threats may lead to incidents (and thereby risks) by  exploiting vulnerabilities

```

```ad-info
title: A bit of Terminology
![[ISG45.png]]

```

## Risk Analysis
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
The risk analysis is the activity aiming to estimate and determine the level of the identified risks.

```

>**_Observation 1_**: the risk level is derived from the combination of the likelihood and consequence

![[ISG46.png]]

### Likelihoods Estimation
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
Likelihood estimation is to determine the frequency or probability of incidents to occur using the defined likelihood scale.

```

It requires the use of techniques for gathering empirical data. 
Many of the risk-modelling techniques (i.e., Bayesian networks, attack trees, and CORAS diagrams) support the likelihood estimation and documentation.
Very often, we need to understand how risks are most likely to arise, and which threat sources are most important. 
- try to estimate the likelihood that threat sources initiate threats, 
- try to estimate the likelihood that such threats may lead to incidents. 

#### Consequences
> ==RECALL==: An incident represents one risk for each of the assets it harms

Thus, it is necessary to estimate the consequence for each of these assets.
The consequence estimation should be conducted by a walk-through of all identified incidents and assigning the estimates with the involvement of personnel representing the party or someone who can judge consequences on behalf of the party. 

## Risk Evaluation
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
The risk evaluation is the set of activities involving the comparison of the risk analysis results with the risk evaluation criteria to determine which risks should be considered for treatment.

```

This step is quite straightforward given the risk estimates and evaluation criteria. 
However, some steps have to be done:
1. **_Consolidation of risk analysis results_**: focus on the risk estimates that we are uncertain about and where this uncertainty implies doubt about the actual risk level.
2. **_Evaluation of risk level_**.
3. **_Risk aggregation_**: investigate the identified risks to see whether certain sets of risks should be aggregated and evaluated as a single risk 
	- avoid to accept a set of risks that individually are non-critical, yet unacceptable in combination 
	- Investigate situation where a number of separate incidents harm the same asset or where the incidents may be caused by the same threat.
4. **_Risk grouping_**: group risks that have elements in common 

## Risk Treatment
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
The risk treatment is the set of activities aiming to identify and select means for risk mitigation and reduction.

```
In principle, we should seek to treat all risks that are unacceptable, but in the end this is a question of cost and benefit, no matter the risk level:
- if a low risk is very cheap to eliminate, we might do so even if the risk in principle is acceptable.
- if the cost of treating a very high risk is unbearable there may be no other option than to accept it.

The risk treatment activity, therefore, should involve both the identification and the analysis of treatments. 
The analysis should take into account that some treatments can create new risks, and that some groups of treatments can reduce the isolated effect of each other. 

There are four main options for risk treatment:

# Monitoring and Review
```ad-abstract
title: Monitoring
==Monitoring== is the continual checking, supervising, critically observing, or determining the current status in order to identify deviations from the expected or required status.

```

```ad-abstract
title: Review
The ==review== activity is to determine the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the risk management process and framework, as well as risks and treatments.

```

Monitoring and review apply to 
- the underlying risk management framework 
- the risk management process 
- to the identified risks 
- to the measures that the organization implements in order to treat risks 

The main purposes of Monitor and Review process are: 
- Ensure that controls are effective and efficient 
- Obtain further information to improve risk assessment 
- Analyse and learn lessons from incidents, changes, trends, successes, and failures 
- Detect changes 
- Identify emerging risks

Risks are not static and must therefore be monitored and reviewed. 
The monitoring and review of risk serves as a basis for taking actions, such as modifying the risk picture or conducting new risk assessments.

# Monitoring and Review of Risk Management

```ad-question
title: WHY MONITORING AND REVIEW OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS?
To ensure that the framework and process, as well as all related activities, procedures, roles, and responsibilities, remain relevant, appropriate, and adequate for the organization.

```


```ad-question
title: WHAT SHOULD BE MONITORED?
Changes in the internal or external context that may affect the adequacy of the risk management. This may include the following: 
- Legal and environmental context 
- Competition context 
- Assets and asset values 
- Risk evaluation criteria 
- Resources required for adhering to the risk management framework
